PROJECT DOCUMENTATION:TOURISM PREDICTION & RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

 STEP 1 - DATA LOADING
- Loaded dataset: Tourism_Master.csv
- Purpose: Provide user, attraction, and rating information for model training.

 STEP 2 - FEATURE SELECTION
- Dropped non-predictive columns:
  TransactionId, UserId, AttractionId, Attraction, AttractionAddress,
  AttractionType, VisitModeName, CityName, Country, Region, Continent, Rating
- Justification: These fields are identifiers or textual descriptors that cause
  data leakage or redundancy. Rating is dropped from features since it is the target.

 STEP 3 - REGRESSION MODEL
- Target: Rating (numeric values).
- Split: 80% training, 20% testing.
- Model: RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42).
- Justification: Captures non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
- Output: regression_model.pkl

 STEP 4 - CLASSIFICATION MODEL
- Target: Binary satisfaction (Rating >= 3 → 1, else 0).
- Split: 80% training, 20% testing.
- Model: RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42).
- Justification: Provides quick classification of user satisfaction.
- Output: classification_model.pkl

 STEP 5 - RECOMMENDATION MODEL
- Constructed user-item matrix (UserId vs AttractionId, values = Rating).
- Filled missing values with 0.
- Model: NearestNeighbors(metric='cosine', algorithm='brute').
- Justification: Cosine similarity identifies attractions similar to user preferences.
- Output: recommendation_model.pkl, user_item_matrix.pkl

 STEP 6 - MODEL PERSISTENCE
- Saved all trained models and matrices using Joblib:
  regression_model.pkl
  classification_model.pkl
  recommendation_model.pkl
  user_item_matrix.pkl
- Justification: Ensures reproducibility and avoids retraining during deployment.

 STEP 7 - MODEL VERIFICATION
- Reloaded models with joblib.load().
- Verified:
  Regression model → RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
  Classification model → RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
  Recommendation model → NearestNeighbors(algorithm='brute', metric='cosine')
  User-item matrix → Shape (33530, 30)


STREAMLIT APPLICATION INTERFACE


INTERFACE OVERVIEW
- Title: "Tourism Prediction & Recommendation System"
- Sections:
  1. Regression: Predict Attraction Rating
  2. Classification: Satisfied vs Unsatisfied
  3. Recommendation: Attractions for a User

REGRESSION SECTION
- Input: 13 numeric feature values (entered via number fields).
- Action: Click "Predict Rating".
- Output: Predicted numeric rating (e.g., 3.75).
- Justification: Allows user to estimate attraction rating based on input features.

 CLASSIFICATION SECTION
- Input: 13 numeric feature values (entered via number fields).
- Action: Click "Classify Satisfaction".
- Output: "Satisfied" (if predicted class = 1) or "Unsatisfied" (if predicted class = 0).
- Justification: Provides a quick binary classification of user satisfaction.

RECOMMENDATION SECTION
- Input: User ID (integer between 1 and 33530).
- Action: Click "Recommend Attractions".
- Output: List of recommended Attraction IDs (nearest neighbors).
- Justification: Suggests attractions similar to those rated by the selected user.

USER INSTRUCTIONS
- For regression/classification → Enter 13 values (e.g., 1,0,3,2,5,0,1,4,2,3,1,0,2).
- For recommendation → Enter a valid User ID (e.g., 1, 25, 100).
- Outputs are displayed instantly in the Streamlit interface.

PROJECT JUSTIFICATION

- Regression model predicts exact attraction ratings.
- Classification model predicts satisfaction levels (Satisfied vs Unsatisfied).
- Recommendation model suggests attractions based on user similarity.
- Saving models as .pkl files ensures modularity, reproducibility, and deployment readiness.
- Streamlit app integrates all models into a user-friendly interface with clear inputs and outputs.
